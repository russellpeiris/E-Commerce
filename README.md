# E-Commerce MERN Stack

This was my first MERN application, I watched a tutorial by lama dev, and I was able to successfully develop the frontend and backend, however, I failed to during integration.
(I have used my own styles)
Please note that this was the very first MERN application I tried to develop with no prior experience. Following the tutorial was so frustrating as they were over 3 hours.
